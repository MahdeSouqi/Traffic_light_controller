# Traffic_light_controller
A simple traffic light controller that controls two traffic lights .

The first traffic light is for the main street that should stay green as long as the by street motion sensor read is zero (no car on the bystreet),
so when a car come the bystreet the sensor read will become high so the bystreet will become green as long as the sensor read is high and then it will gose back to red and the main street will be green .
